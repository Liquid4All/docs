# Cats vs dogs identification from images

In this example, you will learn how to fine-tune a Liquid Foundation Model to identify cats and dogs from images.

## Environment setup

You will need:

- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage Python dependencies and run the application efficiently without creating virtual environments manually.

## Step 1. Establishing baseline accuracy

Go ahead and clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Paulescu/image-classification-with-local-vlms.git
cd image-classification-with-local-vlms
```

Then, install the dependencies into a virtual environment using uv:
```sh
uv sync
```

Evaluation (and especially fine-tuning) scripts typically contain many parameters that need to be set. It is best practice to extracted
them into separate configuration files using whatever format you prefer. In this project we use YAML files, that you
place under the `configs` directory.
