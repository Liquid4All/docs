# Introduction

Liquid AI Edge Platform, or LEAP, is a developer-first platform that seeks to make deploying AI to the edge as easy as calling a cloud-based model API.

Developed by [Liquid AI](https://liquid.ai), a foundation model company committed to building capable AI at every scale, LEAP consists of an integrated system of tools:

- **Model Library:** An online catalog of already trained and quantized model bundles for download
- **Edge SDK:** An SDK for development across a variety of platforms and operating systems
- **Cloud Playground:** A sandbox for testing and experimenting with model response quality via API
- **Apollo:** A mobile app for downloading and vibe-checking LEAP models _in vivo_
- **Search tool:** Find the ideal model based on your specific use-case requirements and constraints _[coming soon]_
- **Bundling service:** Bundle your own finetuned checkpoints on-demand for usage with the Edge SDK _[coming soon]_
- _and more coming soon..._
