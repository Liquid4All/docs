# Edge SDK overview

The LEAP Edge SDK is a native framework for running LEAP models on mobile devices.

## Improving access

Up until now, deploying small language models (SLMs) on mobile devices has been an extremely painful process,
generally accessible to only inference engineers or AI/ML programmers.

Written for Android (Kotlin) and iOS (Swift), the goal of the Edge SDK is to make SLM deployment as easy as calling
a cloud LLM API endpoint - for any app developer.

## Features

The current list of main features includes:

- Model downloading service
- Chat completion (generation)
- Constrained generation
- Function calling
- Gson support (Android)

We are consistently adding to this list - see our [changelog](/docs/changelog) for detailed updates.
