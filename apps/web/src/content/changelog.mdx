- 🛠️ Customization tools: Finetuning
  - Initial release of finetuning tools for LFM2 models on ≤ 1 GPU (Google Colab notebooks) and > 1 GPU (`leap-finetune`)
  - See more details [here](/docs/lfm2/finetuning)
- 📦 Model Bundling Service
  - Use the Finetuning customization tools described above along with `leap-bundle` to develop and deploy finetuned LEAP models on the edge
  - CLI-based service to create model bundles for usage within the Edge SDK - currently supports any model architecture within the LEAP [model library](/models)
  - See more details [here](/docs/leap-bundle/quick-start)
- 🤖 Android Edge SDK
  - Features
    - Added `ModelLoadingOptions` and `GenerationOptions` for more finegrained control over generation and loading options
    - Exposed model ID via `ModelRunner.modelId`
    - Exposed generation statistics via `stats` field on `MessageResponse.Complete`
    - Added Model Downloader module to simplify model fetching in prototypes and development; see details [here](/docs/edge-sdk/android/android-api-spec#model-downloader)
  - 🐛 Bug fixes
    - Added Proguard rules to preserve inference engine class names and prevent obfuscation issues.
    - If the generation content hits the maximum context length, `finishReason` field of `MessageResponse.Complete` will be `EXCEED_CONTEXT`. If the prompt exceeds the context length, `LeapGenerationPromptExceedContextLengthException` will be thrown.
