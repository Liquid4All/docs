# Quick Start

Model Bundling Service is a command-line interface (CLI) that provides two main features:

1. **Model Bundle Requests**: Create and manage custom model bundles for Liquid Edge AI Platform (LEAP)
2. **Manifest Downloads**: Download pre-packaged GGUF models from JSON manifests

This guide will help you quickly get started with both features.

## Install

```sh
pip install leap-bundle
```

---

## Feature 1: Download Pre-packaged Models from Manifests

If you want to quickly download pre-packaged GGUF models without creating custom bundles, you can use the manifest download feature. This doesn't require authentication.

### Quick Start: Manifest Download

Download a pre-packaged model from a JSON manifest URL:

```sh
leap-bundle download https://huggingface.co/LiquidAI/LeapBundles/blob/main/LFM2-Audio-1.5B-GGUF/F16.json
```

This will:
- Download the JSON manifest file
- Download all GGUF model files referenced in the manifest
- Create a directory with the downloaded files
- Update the manifest to use relative paths to the downloaded files

You can also specify a custom output directory:

```sh
leap-bundle download https://huggingface.co/LiquidAI/LeapBundles/blob/main/LFM2-Audio-1.5B-GGUF/F16.json --output-path ./my-models
```

:::tip
Manifest downloads don't require authentication with `leap-bundle login`. They work immediately after installation.

## Feature 2: Create Custom Model Bundles

:::info
**Compatability Note:** The Model Bundling Service will work with any finetuned model, as long as
the model architecture comes from a base model that is part of the LEAP model library.
:::

If you have a custom-trained or fine-tuned model, you can create a model bundle for use with LEAP SDK.

Here is a typical user workflow:

- Download an open source base model.
- Customize the base model with your own dataset e.g. by finetuning.
- Create a model bundle using the `leap-bundle` CLI for LEAP SDK.

### Authenticate

1. Sign in on the [LEAP website](https://leap.liquid.ai/sign-in)

2. Click the account icon on the top right, and go to your [`profile`](https://leap.liquid.ai/profile)

3. Select the [`API keys` tab](https://leap.liquid.ai/profile#/api-keys) and create a new API key

![api-key-screenshot](/img/leap/leap-bundle/api-keys.png)

4. Authenticate the Model Bundling Service with your API token:

```sh
leap-bundle login <api-key>
```

Example output:

```sh
ℹ Validating API token...
✓ Successfully logged in to LEAP platform!
```

### Create model bundle

1. Prepare your model checkpoint.
2. Create a bundle request:

```sh
leap-bundle create <path-to-your-model-checkpoint>
```

Example output:

```sh
ℹ Calculating directory hash...
ℹ Submitting bundle request...
✓ Bundle request created with ID: 1
ℹ Starting upload...
Uploading directory... ✓
✓ Upload completed successfully! Request ID: 1
```

3. Check request status:

```sh
leap-bundle list
```

Example output:

```sh
Bundle Requests (50 most recent)
┏━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃ ID   ┃ Input Path                      ┃ Status       ┃ Creation               ┃ Notes                       ┃
┡━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┩
│ 1    │ /path/to/your/model/directory   │ processing   │ 2024-01-15T10:30:00Z   │ Request is being processed. │
└──────┴─────────────────────────────────┴──────────────┴────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────┘
✓ Found 1 bundle requests.
```

Get details for a specific request:

```sh
leap-bundle list <request-id>
```

Example output:

```sh
✓ Request Details:
  ID:         1
  Input Path: /path/to/your/model/directory
  Status:     completed
  Creation:   2024-01-15T10:30:00Z
  Update:     2024-01-15T10:45:00Z
  Notes:
```

4. When the request is `Completed`, you can download the bundle:

```sh
leap-bundle download <request-id>
```

Example output:

```sh
ℹ Requesting download for bundle request 1...
✓ Download URL obtained for request 1
Downloading bundle output... ✓
✓ Download completed successfully! File saved to: input-8da4w_output_8da8w-seq_8196.bundle
```

The model bundle file will be saved in the current directory with a `.bundle` extension.

### Complete Example

Here's a complete example showing the full workflow:

```sh
# 1. Install and authenticate
pip install leap-bundle
leap-bundle login <api-key>
leap-bundle whoami

# 2. Create a bundle request
leap-bundle create <model-directory>

# 3. Monitor the request (repeat until completed)
leap-bundle list

# 4. Download when ready
leap-bundle download <request-id>

# 5. Your bundle file is now ready to use!
ls -la <downloaded-bundle-file>
```

### Managing Requests

#### Cancel a Request

If you need to cancel a request that's still processing:

```sh
leap-bundle cancel <request-id>
```

Example output:

```sh
ℹ Cancelling bundle request 1...
✓ Request cancelled successfully.
```

### Log out

You can log out to clear your stored credentials:

```sh
leap-bundle logout
```

Example output:

```sh
✓ Successfully logged out from LEAP platform!
```

## Next Steps

- Visit the [LEAP Model Library](https://leap.liquid.ai/models) to explore available models.
- Check the [CLI Spec](/leap/leap-bundle/cli-spec) for detailed command reference.
