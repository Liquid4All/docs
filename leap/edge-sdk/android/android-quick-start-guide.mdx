# Quick Start Guide

## 1. Prerequisites

You should already have:

- An Android project created in Android Studio. You may create an empty project with the wizard. LEAP Android SDK is Kotlin-first. We recommend to work with the SDK only in Kotlin.
- Leap Android SDK needs [Kotlin Android plugin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/releases.html#update-to-a-new-kotlin-version) v2.2.0 or above and [Android Gradle Plugin](https://developer.android.com/build/releases/gradle-plugin) v8.12.0 or above to build. Declare it in `build.gradle.kts` as
  ```kotlin
  plugins {
   id("com.android.application") version "8.12.0" apply false
   id("com.android.library") version "8.12.0" apply false
   id("org.jetbrains.kotlin.android") version "2.2.0" apply false
  }
  ```
- A working Android device that supports `arm64-v8a` ABI with [developer mode enabled](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options). We recommend having 3GB+ of RAM to run the models.
- The minimal SDK requirement is API 31. Declare it in `build.gradle.kts` as
  ```kotlin
  android {
   defaultConfig {
    minSdk = 31
    targetSdk = 36
   }
  }
  ```

:::warning
The SDK may crash on loading model bundles on simulators. A physical Android device is
recommended.
:::

## 2. Import the LeapSDK

Add the following dependencies into `$PROJECT_ROOT/app/build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
dependencies {
  ...

  implementation("ai.liquid.leap:leap-sdk:0.7.4")
}
```

Then perform a project sync in Android Studio to fetch the LeapSDK artifacts.

## 3. Getting and Loading Models  

The SDK supports two methods for loading models.

- GGUF manifests. This is the recommended for new projects because of superior inference performance and good default generation parameters.
- Executorch bundles (legacy)

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="automatic" label="GGUF manifests (recommended)" default>

The LeapSDK supports direct downloads of GGUF files from the [LeapBundles repository](https://huggingface.co/LiquidAI/LeapBundles/tree/main). You can point directly to a remote JSON manifest, and the SDK will automatically download the necessary GGUF files along with generation parameters for optimal performance.

### Loading from remote GGUF manifest (recommended)

The `LeapManifestProcessor.loadModel` suspend function loads a model and returns a model runner instance for invoking the model. This function takes some time to finish as loading the model is a heavy I/O operation, but it is safe to call on the main thread. The function should be executed in a coroutine scope.

```kotlin
lifecycleScope.launch {
  try {
    // Point to the JSON manifest URL in the LeapBundles repo
    val manifestUrl = "https://huggingface.co/LiquidAI/LeapBundles/resolve/main/LFM2-350M-PII-Extract-JP-GGUF/Q5_K_M.json"
    val baseDir = File(context.filesDir, "model_files").absolutePath
    val config = LeapManifestProcessorConfig(targetDir = baseDir, validateSha256 = true)
    val processor = LeapManifestProcessor(config = config)
    val modelRunner = processor.loadModel(manifestUrl)
   }
   catch (e: LeapModelLoadingException) {
     Log.e(TAG, "Failed to load the model. Error message: ${e.message}")
   }
 }
```

The SDK will automatically download the required GGUF files to the device's cache and load the model with the appropriate generation parameters specified in the manifest.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="manual" label="Executorch bundles (legacy)">

Browse the [Leap Model Library](https://leap.liquid.ai/models) to find and download a model bundle that matches your needs.

### Download and transfer bundle (legacy)

Push the bundle file to the device using `adb push`. Assuming the downloaded model file is located at `~/Downloads/model.bundle`, run the following commands:

```shell
adb shell mkdir -p /data/local/tmp/leap/
adb push ~/Downloads/model.bundle /data/local/tmp/leap/model.bundle
```

### Loading from local bundle file (legacy)

The `LeapClient.loadModel` suspend function loads a model bundle file and returns a model runner instance for invoking the model. This function takes some time to finish as loading the model is a heavy I/O operation, but it is safe to call on the main thread. The function should be executed in a coroutine scope.

```kotlin
lifecycleScope.launch {
  try {
    modelRunner = LeapClient.loadModel("/data/local/tmp/leap/model.bundle")
   }
   catch (e: LeapModelLoadingException) {
     Log.e(TAG, "Failed to load the model. Error message: ${e.message}")
   }
 }
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## 4. Generate content with the model

In order to generate contents, a conversation object should be created from the model runner.

```kotlin
val conversation = modelRunner.createConversation()
```

With user input text, we can use `Conversation.generateResponse` function to invoke the generation. Its return value is a Kotlin asynchronous flow of `MessageResponse`, which can be processed with Kotlin flow operators:

```kotlin
val input = "Here is a user message!"
val generationJob = lifecycleScope.launch {
  conversation.generateResponse(input).onEach {
    when (it) {
      is MessageResponse.Chunk -> {
        Log.d(TAG, "text chunk: ${it.text}")
      }
      is MessageResponse.ReasoningChunk -> {
        Log.d(TAG, "reasoning chunk: ${it.text}")
      }
      else -> {
        // ignore other response
      }
    }
  }
  .onCompletion {
     Log.d(TAG, "Generation done!")
  }
  .catch { exception ->
    Log.e(TAG, "Error in generation: $exception")
  }
  .collect()
}
```

In this code snippet:

- `onEach` callback will be called when the model generates a chunk of content.
- `onCompletion` callback will be called when the generation is done. At this time point, `conversation.history` will have the latest message generated by the model.
- `catch` callback will be called if an exception is thrown from the generation.

To interrupt the generation, simply cancel the generation job returned from the coroutine scope `launch` method:

```kotlin
generationJob.cancel()
```
